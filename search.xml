    <content type="text"><![CDATA[the billions level productThink about these guys in the world, who defined products/services used by billions people, they are more than model innovation, but really make a diffrence in most people’s life. e.g. iPhone, facebook, Google, they are not created from nowhere, but went through product iterations by iterations, and they only imerge when the tech, the market, the time all are in perfect. How many people in history achieved here? in any sense, it’s the history choose that person, not that person made history. so take it easy even you are not the 0.01%. in the promising marketmost people in their life time neither can be the next Jobs, nor Bill Gates. that’s the reality, no sad but clean expectation in the end before really in the last day of life. the second goal is easier, find a promising market and lead a small product, maybe lucky invovled in a domain market finally. You are not significant, but one of other 5000 competitors. Even this career path, however, you can’t expect the normal lifestyle: start at 25 and retire at 55 with enough 401K to death. If so, mostly you will be fired out someday in 30s or 40s. Chinese say, “if you dont plan far, you will be in trouble soon” so what may be the promising market subset in automotive software in next 5 years? generally say: 1) service, consulting; 2) self-business; 3)tech expert. in specificly saying: 1) electricity, energy infrastructure; 2) connected, cloud infrastructure; 3) autonomous vehicle.4) mobile apps, which is the carrier for the first 3. I mean the trend is so clear these days. No one can say he dont’ know where should stand in future. but where are you now? I like the model Elon Musk mentioned when do future plan: what’s your reality, what’s your goal, how to meet the gap, than focus on acting. will automotive software like mobile smartphones ?It’s interesting even now there are few third-party or independent “automotive software” companines, on opposite, in mobile market, there are lots of small or big third-party developing companines around Andriod, iOS, the mobile ecosystem is plenty and diversity. the reality in automotive field is lack of abstraction and separation between bottom hardware and top applications. in a mature mobile ecosystem, developer -&gt; end-usersin automotive software ecosystem, devleoper –&gt; OEM –&gt; end-users some auto allience is working on(AutoSAR). as developers, either gain some knowledge in hardware/control to solve the gap, or waiting for the day. what I expect on the way, may be like mobile time:1) automotive OS platform2) vehicle apps3) infrastures extending once the platform is unified, suppose many new auto branchs will emergy. like HTC, Xiaomi, Vivo, Huawei, Lenvo branches after Andriod OS. then new market stratgey is highly required, also traditional OEMs will be heavily impacted. OEM don’t like mobile ecosystemthis may happen soon or never, since OEM don’t like this trend. most possiblely, automotive software developers will highly rely on OEMs. so where will I stand in next 5-years ? OEM is good at strategy study and product integration. at a tech supplier, the benefit is more product driven experience. OEM suppose to have the advantage at automotive platform built-up, but reality is big Internet/software companies with product-level solutions, and OEM doesn’t. it is clear for me in next 5-years to jump into electric, connected, autonomous related industries, either at OEM level or supplier level. Also it is the time to do some study at automotive platform vendors.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[what industry will you be in? in every industry, the product should be the core to define all other supporting teams, the market team, the product design team, IT team, manufacture team etc. so my answer suppose to be vehicle, or maybe I even should not limit here. as an mechanical/mechanics based engieer for three years, I realized there are three aspects: 1 solid knowledge in this special field, e.g. Mechanical has concept of stress, material property; market has concept of supply chain, product strategy, customer expectation; 2 fluent with the industry tools, which give the feeling you can fix the world by it, e.g. CAD/CAE tools to mechanical, programming tools to developers; 3 passion in the product, which is the driven force to explore and creativity. Do I have passion in vehicle? Or Do I feel the pain/hurt due to any unsolved issues in vehicle? maybe no, that’s why I stay in surface even after 3-years, don’t feel the pain neither the fire. knowledge is almost the easist part, which answer “what”, the true barrier is about tools(how) and passion(why). From knowledge level, reading couple professional books will be enough to absolve the concepts in a new acknowledge. career passionBut why you want to involve in this job? most people even don’t go to why, since reality is here: after getting married, pay the house fee, kids taken after. Job is a job, to support family, period. I love family, by the way. but don’t take family as an excuse for muddy career. Is there a field that knowledge is the tool? maybe AI, so far AI products is limited, e.g. voice, image. so tools are highly overlapped with knowledge. It sounds like an easy-in field. for a while as AI maturing and becoming an common service, then AI related products will burst out in every field, then product/market/capital-driven occupy. It’s a bad strategy to chase after market hot topics to develop personal career path. Current market trend is helpful, but there is no clear next-10-year market goal; on personal level, however, you definitely need a clear next 5/10-year goal, then every small adjust should point to that goal. so basically there are two categories: knowledge-driven, which is new coming e.g. AI; market-driven, which is always matured, e.g. automotive, smart phones. I suppose the matured market, if lacking creative input(vey much based on customer needs, market trends), is going to sunset sooner or later; the knowldege-driven market is bursting on the way, and absorving/requiring more and more labors. so where I am now, and where will I be in next 5-year? How do you survive in a matured market, or are you born to be the new-comers? and is the new-comers achievable? e.g. will AI related knowledge/tools be easy to catch? if in a matured market (automotive CAE)if I dont figure out a clear 5-year goal, most possiblely I will stay very unhappy in CAE the next 5 years; also very possible I can’t tolerant the work environemnt any more, and jump to any field at that time accept me; few chance to refresh my opinions and define a CAE sub-market. there are a few concerns. First, it’s not good to change direction immidetialy anytime the market is down, that’s too risk if you don’t setup the long-term goal. Second, in a sunset field, it’s not only about salary not high, the hidden aspects includes scattered office environoment, lay-off dangerous, not been valued, which will change the person into sunset. I mean, even a sunset period still need labers to maintain, but depends on personality, not for me somehow. what may be the CAE sub-market to rise? I can feel the tools is still highly used in automotive fields, but the maturity in CAE software products requires few new development, some new try into autonomous vehicle safety will not be a burst. Another try is in cloud based environment, is more like a sub-applications for the cloud vendors, it’s kind of a pattern innovation, not a product innovation. Due to the fewer chances in mature products, the level of candicates is actually high, most openings requries PhD. the mature market is a employer market, not employees friendly. And the education system may take decades to make a shift, during the period the employee somehow have to be devalued, because of the market decide their values. if in a new market (AI)by all menas, a new market does have more chances and promising futures and all the benifits where the mature market doesn’t have. The point is how to transfer from a mature market employee to a new market employee. I mentioned before, three aspects, knowledge, tools, and passion. Love it first, and the knowledge and familar with tools will achieved. need more discussion in next time.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Backgroud:Due to 6-year school experince in mechanics, I was native to jump into CAE position. But I have few willing with CAD, which is very fundemental to be a qualified Product-Design side engineer. so I am not. So I am in a CAE tools support team, where I don’t directly design, mainly in enhancement, deployment etc, where understandthe old code, and write new function code, track bugs, system configure is enough. even in the big CAE vendors companies(Altair, Dassult System), the new methodlogy invest is very possibly less than product integration and customer consultings. what’s changing:the trend of CAE tools in OEMs demenstrates less investment, not because CAE tools are less used, but the CAE methodlodgy/process is really mature; new trends are arising, e.g. connected vehicles(CV), smart city, autonomous vehicles(AV), all of which require different knowledge and mindset(from mechanical to EE/CS). In 2017 Sep, I enrolled Udacity self-driving car, which gave some knowledge(openCV, deep learning, data fusion, object detect, plan algorithm), and the problems in AV. This field is so hot that openings around everywhere, basically California companies are high-demand, looking for a strong guy, AI expert, or senior automotiveengineer; while Michigan companies are old fasion, more on system integration level, and the required skills are random. if it’s a turning pointwhile Udacity didn’t work for me and AV is too young to all-in invest.For a while I am actually back to CAE, tried to enjoy it. But bad news keep coming, less projects funded, and frustrated office environment, so I move on. this time, IoT(connected vehicles) come to mind. it is really an old topic, since 2008 at college, IBM throw the big vision: smart earth to connect everything. Decades passed, finally the infrastructure, the application levels(transport, home, offices) are prepared-well. Good for me, I track AGL, GENIVI open source projects for around a year already and had 8-months experience in mobile developement(RESTful, server-client model), all bring me some fresh idea in connected vehicles. To study the automotive embedded software system, I tracked freeRTOS first, cause it’s easy since knowldege in Linux; about applications based on RTOS, however, I have no idea, e.g. vehicle dynamics, body/engine/powertrain control components, sensors, algorithms. While they are new but not difficult, hopefully can be familar in short period. softwares in connected vehiclesThere are two sections: the vehicle development, including traditional control components, which requires professional knowledge in vehicle dynamics, ECU; Vehicle Infotainment(IVI)components, which is like mobile developement. this section already has standard architecture, e.g. AutoSar secondly the vehicle to surroundings, either cloud device, peronsal mobile devices, or other vehicles. which requires: cloud infrastructures, communication protocol, security vendors, Android/IOS mobile apps, and IoT hardware vendors. it’s a clear big market, also it presents more valuable to do business than to be an engineer in each small field. the reasons come to mind, 1)architecture is done, no big mind/theory updated ; 2) so all should be about products, the integration components to market products is virtual. on-goingCAE softwares is heavy-math/numerical algorithms demanding; on the other side, embedded softwares is like enterprise Java, more on logic flow. As the population of mobile frameworks, and standarlization in automotive embedded system, the threshold suppose become lower. On the other hand, the dependence on suppliers’ libs and the test/release on hardwares may draw the life cycle of embedded software development longer. To explore embedded softwares may not the right career path, but no doubt it’s good to know what’s happening there. Finally, Either embrace the changing or wait it come to you, I mean, both are good stragies, maybe!]]></content>
